Header Information:
    • The first 20 bytes (from 0000 to 0019) are the IP header and transport layer header. These include source and destination IP addresses, protocol information, and checksums. 
    • The 08 00 at offset 0016 indicates that this is an IPv4 packet. 
      TLS Record Layer:
    • The TLS record layer begins at offset 0020. 
    • The first byte (17) represents the content type. it’s an Application Data message. 
    • The next two bytes (03 03) indicate the TLS version (TLS 1.2). 
    • The following two bytes (00 22) represent the length of the encrypted data (34 bytes). 
    • Encrypted Data:
    • The encrypted data starts at offset 0024 (53 ca 22 bd ...). 
    • These bytes are opaque to us because they are encrypted making it unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys.
